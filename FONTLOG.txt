FONTLOG for the Wire One font

This file provides detailed information on the Vidaloka 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Vidaloka fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Wire One is a condensed monoline sans designed by Alexei Vanyashin and Gayaneh Bagdasaryan from Cyreal Type Foundry.

Its modular-based characters are flavored with a sense of art nouveau. Nearly hairline thickness suggests usage for body text above 12px. While at display sizes it reveals its tiny dot terminals to create a sharp mood in headlines.

It is recommended to adjust letter-spacing for sizes below 30px to 0.033em and up. For 12 px we recommend the value of 0.085em.

Wire One is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
